## Notes

This font software _does not_ contain standard Latin script but instead is designed for use with D'ni, a constructed language from the Myst video game universe, developed by Cyan Inc. / Cyan Worlds Inc. This font software is in no way owned, endorsed, or supported by Cyan Inc. / Cyan Worlds Inc.

It is important to note that this font software makes use of the New Transcription Standard for D'ni, otherwise known as NTS. Each character of D'ni corresponds to a glyph in this typeface. For a handy reference for NTS, see the D'ni Font Chart (http://www.mystembassy.net/downloads/dnifontchart.pdf).
